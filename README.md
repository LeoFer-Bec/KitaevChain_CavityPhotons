# KitaevChain_SingleModePhotons

The codes in this repository simulate a Kitaev chain embedded in a single mode photonic cavity.

The python file "KitaevModel_CavityEmbedded.py" computes the hamiltonian and find the eigenenergies and eigenstates.

The jupyter notebooks process the eigenenergies and eingenstates to compute the photon number, field quadratures, and photon probabilities.
